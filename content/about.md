Hi! I'm a data analyst with experience in R, Python, and statistical modeling. This site is my personal CV and blog.

I have mainly worked as a model developer in Credit Risk in ANZ and EY.
I have experience in IRB Wholesale PD modelling and IFRS9 ECL modelling.

I enjoy working on open data projects and sharing what I learn along the way.
